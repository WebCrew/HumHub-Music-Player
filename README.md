## HumHub - Music-Player

A module which should add a panel on the HumHub Dashboard, with a music player widget to play Soundcloud playlists.

The images serve as an example, how the finished module should look:

The basic structure of the module is already created. I unfortunately have not enough knowledge about PHP and Yii and I need technical assistance to finish the module. It should be not much work to complete the task, so you are welcome to help.

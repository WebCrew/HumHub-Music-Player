# HumHub - Music-Player

A module which should add a panel on the HumHub Dashboard, with a music player widget to play Soundcloud playlists and also internet radio streams. You can use a lot more features and functions and they are easy to setup within one js file.

The images serve as an example, how the finished module should look like:

**Minimal View:**

**Playlist View:**

![Player view 2](https://github.com/WebCrew/HumHub-Music-Player/blob/master/hh_player.jpg?raw=true "Playlist view")

**Album View:**

The basic structure of the module is already created. I unfortunately have not enough knowledge about PHP and Yii and **I need technical assistance to finish the module**. It should be not much work to complete that task, **so you are welcome to help**.

Kind regards,  Andreas Holzer

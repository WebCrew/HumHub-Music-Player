# HumHub - Music-Player

A module which should add a panel on the HumHub Dashboard, with a music player widget to play Soundcloud playlists and also internet radio streams. You can use a lot more features and functions and they are easy to setup within one js file. 

##To Do

- I think I missed some little issues to finish the module, PLEASE help me.
- I think the last little issue is somewhere in the widgets/views/musicplayerframe.php

##Installation

-  open widgets/views/musicplayerframe.php and integrate Your own playlist and Soundcloud Developer ID (you have to generate one at Soundcloud). Rread more about the player features here: https://open.521dimensions.com/amplitudejs/docs#usage
-  upload the module to HumHub/protected/modules/
-  rename the module to **musicplayer**
-  go to HumHub Admin Backend and activate the module
-  have fun using it :)


###Playlist View:
